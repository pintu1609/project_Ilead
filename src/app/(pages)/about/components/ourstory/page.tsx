            In the last half a decade or so, we have succeeded in establishing a global platform for dialogues, nurturing diverse thoughts and ideas and influencing policy decisions with suggestions, which are rooted in strong evidence through our &ldquo;Celebrating New India&rdquo; initiative.
          </p>
          <p className='text-lg text-justify'>
            Our other prominent initiative, &ldquo;iLEAD Women&rdquo;, has empowered women through mentorship and built a strong community, challenging traditional norms and advocating for gender equality.

            We successfully organised the &ldquo;Rising Leaders - for Inclusive & Progressive Change&rdquo; program, including a significant event from December 2-4, 2023, in Delhi, bringing together leaders and emerging talents. We have trained an estimated 20-26 youth per batch and our program has proved to be a success.
